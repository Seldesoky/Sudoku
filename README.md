## Gameâ€™s Name: Sudoku for Gurus

### Description
Sudoku for Gurus is a web-based version of the classic number puzzle game, Sudoku. The game is designed to provide players with an engaging and challenging experience as they attempt to fill a 9x9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids contain all of the digits from 1 to 9. I chose to develop this game because I love solving puzzles. Also, as a Fun Fact! working on a puzzle reinforces connections between brain cells. It improves mental speed and is an effective way to improve short-term memory. Puzzles increase the production of dopamine, a chemical that regulates mood, memory, and concentration. Dopamine is released with every success as we solve the puzzle. Thus, you get to work on your health while having Fun.
